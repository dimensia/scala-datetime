My Scala Date&Time Experiment

Goals: Perfect Scala integration (Pattern matching, case classes, implicits, Builders & Factories, dafault and names parameters, etc. ...)

 - Currently nothing works. If you need something useable NOW, this is not the place to look.
 - The source code is based on the Date&Time library (JSR-310) and was translated to Scala 
   (mostly automatic, with quite some help from IntelliJ's "Convert Java to Scala" functionality).
 - Class hierarchy and naming has not been changed.
 - Most of the Java enumerations, static initializers and classes with multiple constructors are fixed, but a few tricky ones remain.
 - Usages of BigInteger/BigDecimal are replaced by BigInt/BigDecimal.
 - Some algorithms could need further cleanup.
 - Most instances of Java's "constructor arguments + field + getter" pattern are already replaced by class Foo(val bar: ...) or similiar
 - The code still uses Java collections instead of Scala collections
 - A few places with "break" and "continue" need investigation to be replaced.
 - The Scala packages still have the "javax.time" namespace.
 - The code uses no implicits. These might be added in the future, when things are a bit more stable.
 - Methods returning something like "Integer (or null)" have been replaced by "Some[Int]".
 - Java classes which are replaced by Scala classes have been renamed to *._java_
 - There are some classes which do some "reification" magic. These might be replaced by a simple Manifest.
 - ResourceZoneRulesDataProvider, StandardZoneRules, PeriodUnit and TZDBZoneRulesCompiler need additional attention.
 - JavaDoc-style comments need to converted to ScalaDoc-style comments.

I did the whole thing for fun and curiosity.
