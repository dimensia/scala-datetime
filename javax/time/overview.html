<h3>JSR-310</h3>
<p>
JSR-310 defines a new Date and Time API for Java.
The API describes the two basic forms of time - machine and human.
</p>
<p>
Machine time is designed for machines, and is defined by a single incrementing number.
This is often associated with the result from <code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code>.
</p>
<p>
The main class for representing machine time is <code>Instant</code>.
It uses nanosecond precision and can support a range greater than the age of the universe.
</p>
<p>
Human time is designed for humans, and is based around meaningful fields.
Examples of the fields include year, month-of-year, quarter-of-year and hour-of-day.
</p>
<p>
The most basic classes representing human time are <code>LocalDate</code>,
<code>LocalTime</code> and <code>LocalDateTime</code>.
These represent dates and times without any offset from UTC or time-zone.
</p>
<p>
The next level of classes add the offset from UTC, such as "+01:00" -
<code>OffsetDate</code>, <code>OffsetTime</code> and <code>OffsetDateTime</code>.
These still do not contain time-zone information, just the offset.
</p>
<p>
The final level adds the time-zone rules, such as "Europe/London" - <code>ZonedDateTime</code>.
</p>
<p>
In combination, these seven classes represent the possible combinations of valid date
and time information. Furthermore, these classes can only ever be in a valid state.
They are also immutable.
</p>
<p>
These classes, and the whole of the main API, is specific to the ISO calendar system.
This is the <i>de facto</i> world calendar following the proleptic Gregorian rules.
The <code>i18n</code> package contains other calendar systems.
